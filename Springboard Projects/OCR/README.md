# OCR: Pdf Text Processing

#### Summary

This repo is where I will be submitting my work for processing Pdf and object character recognition (OCR).

The project will involve:
- Preparing and pre-processing for the Pdf
- Model comparisons (pytesseract, pyocr, easyocr)
- Image processing for check-box selected determination
- Final Pipeline process with Streamlit.

My work will be mostly located in the jupyter notebooks, however I will also be linking a Streamlit app that will serve as an example for the complete pipeline.
